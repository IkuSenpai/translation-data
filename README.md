BlueProtocol fan community localizations

If you wish to discuss translating/localizing Blue Protocol with me, you can used the (dedicated) SkyProc discord:

The BP DB discord also has no issues with English patch / translation discussions:

## **NOTE:**

The /r/BlueProtocolOnline / BPO [discord server](https://discord.gg/5zrZMdX) does not allow discussion of English patches in hopes of becoming the "official" / partnered BP discord channel.

**Please** kindly respect their decisions and do not discuss this project on their server, nor direct any members of the server to this repository. Their community will not be using third party modifications.
