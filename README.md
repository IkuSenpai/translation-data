BlueProtocol fan community localizations


I've been told by moderators of the [main community BP discord channel](https://discord.gg/5zrZMdX) that they do not condone discussion of English patches or data mining. **Please** kindly respect their decisions and do not discuss this project on their server, nor direct any members of the server to this repository.

If you wish to discuss translating/localizing Blue Protocol with me, you can used the (dedicated) SkyProc discord:

The BP DB discord also has no issues with English patch / translation discussions:
